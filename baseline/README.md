# Coastwide Chinook SNP GSI Baseline

[https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.dz08kps5b](https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.dz08kps5b)

This dataset contains genotypes that can be used to make genetic stock identification estimates of Chinook salmon.

## Description of the data and file structure

The files are formatted for the program Ms.GSI.  There is a single Tier1 baseline file, and three Tier2 baseline files containing genotypes (file names = (`*_Genotypes.csv`).

These files contain the columns:

sampletype - should be "reference" for all individuals

indiv - Unique identifier for each individual

collection - the population or sample each individual belongs to

repunit - the reporting group each individual belongs to

Subsequent columns contain the genotypes for each locus (2 columns per locus)

Each baseline file also has an accompanying `pop_info` file (file names = "*pop_info.csv"). These files have the columns:

collection - Population or sample corresponding to those in the baseline file

repunit - Reporting group each collection belongs to

grpvec - A unique numerical value for each reporting group

The baseline files can also be used in the program Rubias.

The numeric allele designations were converted from the original base designations using the commonly used translation: A = 1, C = 2, G = 3, T = 4, "-" = 5.
